                        Code Outlaw was founded by Benjamin Ayangbola.He initiated a free training on Software Development. This traning spanned from the 
                        9th of November, 2020 to 9th of February, 2021.
                        This is the final project given for the basic class in Software Development. In this project, we are to create an HTML page showing image card
                        for each profile given in the project.js file - the page should include arrows to the left and to the right of each card, such that
                        on click of the arrows, the next or previous card is loaded to view. The project should be in a folder which should include the 
                        index.html, main.css and main.js. The project should be uploaded on GitHub repo and named "my-code-outlaws-project"

                        This Project was first deployed on the 26th of February, 2021 and upon starting a carrer as a UI/UX developer at Aimtoget Technologies, I had to edit
                        the content of the page to suit the Managers specifications.

                        This project was supervised by Brainlord and Boffin. I made use of the Grid, flex box, and others
